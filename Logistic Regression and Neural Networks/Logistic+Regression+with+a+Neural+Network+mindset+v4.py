# ## 2 - Overview of the Problem set ##
# 
# Dataset ("data.h5") containing:
#     - a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
#     - a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
#     - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).
# 
# Goal: Build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
# 
# Loading the data (cat/non-cat)
train_set_x_orig, train_set_y, test_set_x_orig, test_set_y, classes = load_dataset()


# We added "_orig" at the end of image datasets (train and test) because we are going to preprocess them. After preprocessing, we will end up with train_set_x and test_set_x (the labels train_set_y and test_set_y don't need any preprocessing).
# 
# Each line of your train_set_x_orig and test_set_x_orig is an array representing an image. You can visualize an example by running the following code. Feel free also to change the `index` value and re-run to see other images. 

# Example of a picture
index = 25
plt.imshow(train_set_x_orig[index])
print ("y = " + str(train_set_y[:, index]) + ", it's a '" + classes[np.squeeze(train_set_y[:, index])].decode("utf-8") +  "' picture.")


# Many software bugs in deep learning come from having matrix/vector dimensions that don't fit. If you can keep your matrix/vector dimensions straight you will go a long way toward eliminating many bugs.

# For convenience, you should now reshape images of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) in a numpy-array of shape (num_px $*$ num_px $*$ 3, 1). After this, our training (and test) dataset is a numpy-array where each column represents a flattened image. There should be m_train (respectively m_test) columns.

# To represent color images, the red, green and blue channels (RGB) must be specified for each pixel, and so the pixel value is actually a vector of three numbers ranging from 0 to 255.
# 
# One common preprocessing step in machine learning is to center and standardize your dataset, meaning that you substract the mean of the whole numpy array from each example, and then divide each example by the standard deviation of the whole numpy array. But for picture datasets, it is simpler and more convenient and works almost as well to just divide every row of the dataset by 255 (the maximum value of a pixel channel).
# 
# <!-- During the training of your model, you're going to multiply weights and add biases to some initial inputs in order to observe neuron activations. Then you backpropogate with the gradients to train the model. But, it is extremely important for each feature to have a similar range such that our gradients don't explode. You will see that more in detail later in the lectures. !--> 
# 
# Let's standardize our dataset.


train_set_x = train_set_x_flatten/255.
test_set_x = test_set_x_flatten/255.


# Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
# - Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
# - Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px \* num_px \* 3, 1)
# - "Standardize" the data

# ## 3 - General Architecture of the learning algorithm ##
# 
# It's time to design a simple algorithm to distinguish cat images from non-cat images.
# 
# Build a Logistic Regression, using a Neural Network mindset. The following Figure explains why **Logistic Regression is actually a very simple Neural Network!**
# 
# <img src="images/LogReg_kiank.png" style="width:650px;height:400px;">
# 
# **Mathematical expression of the algorithm**:
# 
# For one example $x^{(i)}$:
# $$z^{(i)} = w^T x^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$
# $$\hat{y}^{(i)} = a^{(i)} = sigmoid(z^{(i)})\tag{2}$$ 
# $$ \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) =  - y^{(i)}  \log(a^{(i)}) - (1-y^{(i)} )  \log(1-a^{(i)})\tag{3}$$
# 
# The cost is then computed by summing over all training examples:
# $$ J = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\tag{6}$$
# 
# **Key steps**:
# Steps: 
#     - Initialize the parameters of the model
#     - Learn the parameters for the model by minimizing the cost  
#     - Use the learned parameters to make predictions (on the test set)
#     - Analyse the results and conclude

# ## 4 - Building the parts of our algorithm ## 
# 
# The main steps for building a Neural Network are:
# 1. Define the model structure (such as number of input features) 
# 2. Initialize the model's parameters
# 3. Loop:
#     - Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
#     - Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
#     - Update parameters (gradient descent)
# 
# You often build 1-3 separately and integrate them into one function we call `model()`.
#

# ### 4.3 - Forward and Backward propagation
# 
# Now that your parameters are initialized, you can do the "forward" and "backward" propagation steps for learning the parameters.
# 
# 
# Forward Propagation:
# - You get X
# - You compute $A = \sigma(w^T X + b) = (a^{(0)}, a^{(1)}, ..., a^{(m-1)}, a^{(m)})$
# - You calculate the cost function: $J = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}y^{(i)}\log(a^{(i)})+(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-a^{(i)})$
# 
# Here are the two formulas you will be using: 
# 
# $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m}X(A-Y)^T\tag{7}$$
# $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (a^{(i)}-y^{(i)})\tag{8}$$

# You can see the cost decreasing. It shows that the parameters are being learned. However, you see that you could train the model even more on the training set. Try to increase the number of iterations in the cell above and rerun the cells. You might see that the training set accuracy goes up, but the test set accuracy goes down. This is called overfitting. 

# ## 6 - Further analysis (optional/ungraded exercise) ##
# 
# #### Choice of learning rate ####
# 
# In order for Gradient Descent to work you must choose the learning rate wisely. The learning rate $\alpha$  determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may "overshoot" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.
# 
# Let's compare the learning curve of our model with several choices of learning rates. Run the cell below. This should take about 1 minute. Feel free also to try different values than the three we have initialized the `learning_rates` variable to contain, and see what happens.

for i in learning_rates:

plt.ylabel('cost')
plt.xlabel('iterations')

legend = plt.legend(loc='upper center', shadow=True)
frame = legend.get_frame()
frame.set_facecolor('0.90')
plt.show()


# **Interpretation**: 
# - Different learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.
# - If the learning rate is too large (0.01), the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge (though in this example, using 0.01 still eventually ends up at a good value for the cost). 
# - A lower cost doesn't mean a better model. You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.
# - In deep learning, we usually recommend that you: 
#     - Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.
#     - If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting. (We'll talk about this in later videos.) 
# 

# ## 7 - Test with your own image (optional/ungraded exercise) ##
# 

my_image = "my_image.jpg"   # change this to the name of your image file 

# We preprocess the image to fit your algorithm.
fname = "images/" + my_image
image = np.array(ndimage.imread(fname, flatten=False))

plt.imshow(image)
print("y = " + str(np.squeeze(my_predicted_image)) + ", your algorithm predicts a \"" + classes[int(np.squeeze(my_predicted_image)),].decode("utf-8") +  "\" picture.")


# **What to remember:**
# 1. Preprocessing the dataset is important.
# 2. You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
# 3. Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!
